# Machine Learning, Pandas, and Data Science Course

## Overview

Welcome to the **Machine Learning, Pandas, and Data Science** course! This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to data science using Python, with a specific focus on machine learning and the Pandas library. You'll learn how to manipulate data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build machine learning models.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of data science and the role of machine learning.
- Use the Pandas library to manipulate and analyze data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from data.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models using popular algorithms.
- Apply data preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.

## Prerequisites

Before taking this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with basic statistics and linear algebra is helpful but not required.
